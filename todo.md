remove @rneui/themed and @rneui/base
use pure rn components. create some custom
- button, text, input
- adding ui library makes in harder
- for example @rneui/themed was last updated 5 month ago (and its on RC version, which probably means its abandoned)

- preferable is swiftui-react-native
- but it doesn't support android which is extremely lame
